we have a complete list of scopt and a idea here in MD but we now going to create the library from sctrach because of its non maintained proper souce code

we are depended on 3rd party libraries but we dont have to do anything for its setup we will just inform user that please install and do 3rd party library setup your own
this is library list which is 3rd party
- react-native-ble-manager
- react-native-permissions
- convert-string
- text-decoding

our library is like a wrapper of functions to make life easy out of box and maintain a certain repeating logic at one place nothing else.

i want you to first check the scope md files understand all create a plan and then start the development process for this
react native package which will be called 
react-native-bluetooth-obd-manager

BTW i want eslint and typescript based very strickly made and real high standard source code

also create all test case for entire library so that we can be assured about the source code always 

also note we dont want any PID function like get speed, rmp etc we are here to give user a functions to communicate with OBD we are not here to give user this functions like getRMP and all PID things

we are here to make entire library not just todo
todo will have only list in which the old library dont have but here we dont care about old library we have to create all
