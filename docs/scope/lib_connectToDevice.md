Okay, based on the described architecture and the pseudocode example, here is a list of the types of files likely involved in implementing the `connectToDevice` functionality within your `react-native-bluetooth-obd-manager` library:

1.  **Hook Definition File (e.g., `hooks/useBluetooth.ts` or similar):**
    *   **Role:** Exposes the `connectToDevice` function to the end-user's components. It gets the actual implementation or dispatch function from the context.

2.  **Context/Provider File (e.g., `context/BluetoothContext.tsx` or `context/BluetoothProvider.tsx`):**
    *   **Role:** Manages the overall Bluetooth state (`connectedDevice`, error states, etc.) using `useReducer`. It provides the state and the `dispatch` function used by the hook. It might also contain helper functions called by the reducer or directly invoke the core connection logic.

3.  **Reducer File (e.g., `context/BluetoothReducer.ts`):**
    *   **Role:** Handles actions dispatched when `connectToDevice` is called. It triggers the actual connection logic and updates the state (e.g., setting `isLoading`, `connectedDevice`, or `error`) based on the outcome.

4.  **Connection Logic File (Potential - could be part of Context/Reducer or separate):** (e.g., `managers/ConnectionManager.ts`, `services/BluetoothService.ts`, or directly within the Context/Reducer files)
    *   **Role:** Contains the **core implementation** of the connection process. This is where the actual calls to `BleManager.connect`, `BleManager.retrieveServices`, the loop through known UUIDs (`KNOWN_ELM327_TARGETS`), calls to `BleManager.startNotification`, and error handling would reside.

5.  **Constants/Configuration File (e.g., `constants/ble.ts`, `config/obdProfiles.ts`):**
    *   **Role:** Stores the predefined list of known ELM327 Service and Characteristic UUIDs (`KNOWN_ELM327_TARGETS` from the pseudocode example) that the connection logic iterates through.

**In summary, the flow involves:**

User Component -> `useBluetooth` Hook -> Context Dispatch -> Reducer -> Connection Logic (using BLE Manager & Constants) -> Reducer (updates state) -> Context -> Hook (reflects updated state) -> User Component (re-renders).

The exact file names and whether the core logic is separate or embedded within the context/reducer depend on the specific code structure chosen for the library.
