Okay, you are correct. If the requirement is for the library *itself* to add this predictive flag directly to the `Peripheral` object before making it available in the `discoveredDevices` state, then this constitutes a feature request or a "TODO" item, as it modifies the structure of the data returned by the library.

Here is the Markdown documentation for this planned feature:

## TODO / Planned Feature: Predictive `isLikelyOBD` Flag in Discovered Devices

**Current Behavior:**

The `scanDevices` function collects Bluetooth peripherals discovered by `react-native-ble-manager`. The `discoveredDevices` state array currently contains the standard `Peripheral` objects as provided by `BleManager`, typically including `id`, `name`, `rssi`, and `advertising` data.

**Proposed Enhancement:**

To simplify identification of potential OBD adapters in the user interface, a planned enhancement is to add a predictive boolean flag directly to the `Peripheral` objects returned by the library.

**Goal:** Modify the objects within the `discoveredDevices` array to include an additional property, for example `isLikelyOBD`.

```typescript
// Proposed structure of objects in discoveredDevices array:
interface PeripheralWithPrediction extends Peripheral {
  isLikelyOBD: boolean; // Predictive flag added by the library
}

// Example usage after enhancement:
const { discoveredDevices } = useBluetooth(); // discoveredDevices would be PeripheralWithPrediction[]
discoveredDevices.forEach(device => {
  console.log(`Device: ${device.name}, Is Likely OBD?: ${device.isLikelyOBD}`);
  // UI can directly use device.isLikelyOBD for highlighting
});
```

**Implementation Logic (Internal to Library):**

*   When the library's internal `BleManagerDiscoverPeripheral` listener receives a `peripheral` object:
*   Before adding it to the `state.discoveredDevices` array, the library will run a predefined heuristic check.
*   This check will likely examine the `peripheral.name` string (if available) for common keywords associated with OBD adapters (e.g., "OBD", "ELM", "VLINK", "SCAN", "ICAR", etc., case-insensitive).
*   Based on the outcome of this heuristic check, the `isLikelyOBD` flag will be set to `true` or `false`.
*   The modified object (original `Peripheral` data + the new `isLikelyOBD` flag) will then be added to the `discoveredDevices` state array.

**Benefits:**

*   Reduces boilerplate code in the frontend for filtering or identifying potential OBD devices.
*   Provides a consistent identification mechanism directly from the library hook.

**Important Note:**

This flag would be **predictive** and **heuristic-based**. It relies on common naming conventions for OBD adapters.
*   It cannot guarantee with 100% certainty that a device flagged as `true` *is* a functional OBD adapter compatible with the library.
*   It might incorrectly flag devices (`false positives`) or miss poorly named OBD adapters (`false negatives`).
*   The final confirmation of compatibility only happens during the `connectToDevice` attempt when the library checks for specific BLE services and characteristics.

**Status:**

Adding the `isLikelyOBD` flag directly to the `Peripheral` objects within the `discoveredDevices` state is **not currently implemented** but is marked as a **TODO** / planned feature to improve developer experience. Currently, this filtering/prediction logic needs to be implemented in the application code, as shown in previous examples.
